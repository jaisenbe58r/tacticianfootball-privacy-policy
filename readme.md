## Introduction

Andrew McAllister ("we", "our", or "us") operates the mobile video game Tactician Football (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service.

By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service.

## Information Collection and Use

### Personal Information

While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Information"). This may include, but is not limited to:

- **Phone number:** To access the Service, you are required to provide your phone number, which will be verified through an SMS code (OTP - One-Time Password). This information is essential for creating your account and tracking your achievements within the game.
- **Contacts (optional):** With your explicit permission, we may access and upload your contacts to our server to improve your gameplay experience. Specifically, this data will be used to connect you with friends who are also using the app, enabling you to compete with them directly and monitor their progress. You can still use the app if you choose not to share your contacts, though some competitive features may be limited.

#### How We Obtain Your Consent for Contacts:
Before accessing and uploading your contacts, we will clearly inform you of our intent and request your consent. If you decline, we will not access or upload your contacts to our server.

### Usage Data

We may also collect information on how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), device type, operating system, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, and other diagnostic data.

### Data Protection

We are committed to ensuring that your data is secure. We take appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial measures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Use of Data

We use the collected data for various purposes:

- To provide and maintain our Service
- To notify you about changes to our Service
- To allow you to participate in interactive features of our Service when you choose to do so
- To provide customer support
- To monitor the usage of our Service
- To detect, prevent, and address technical issues
- To improve your gaming experience by connecting you with your contacts within the game (only with your explicit consent)

## Disclosure of Data

We will not share your Personal Information with third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy or unless required by law. Your data is kept strictly confidential and is used only to improve your experience with the Service.

## Contacts Data

If you choose to grant access to your contacts, we may upload this data to our server to enable connection with your friends who are also using the app. This information will be used solely for this purpose and will not be shared with any third parties, except as required by law. You may withdraw this permission at any time by adjusting the settings in the app, at which point we will stop collecting and using your contacts data.

## Links to Other Sites

Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site.

## Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.

If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us so that we can take the necessary actions.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
